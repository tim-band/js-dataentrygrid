# js-dataentrygrid
Featherweight Excel-like grid for data entry

At the moment, just an HTML proof-of-concept with the following features:

* Click to edit
* Navigate with Tab and Return
* Auto-insert rows at the end
* Right-click menu with:
  * delete rows
  * insert rows

but lacking:

* Copy and paste
* Multiple row and column selections
* Undo and Redo
* Arrow key navigation
